Final Project

I have been asked to create a website for the Monkees, I have been asked to include a couple of things. I start to think around many different ideas on how I could style the website and how to make it inactive.

Verison One I start by creating three pages, Home Page, Photos and a Video. Creating these were my starting point to get the sytle I wanted. I start to get the Nav Bar sorted, and easy to click on the page you would like. Then I added in the nav bar Sign up and log in but didnt create the pages, as I wanted to come back to this.

Verison Two I decide to change my Video.html to a band.html, mainly because I need to have my information on the page and make more inactive. The video was still on the page but near the bottom. I have use Angular to create a part where when you type the band memebers name in the input part and it will get rid of the information not needed about the other band names.

Verison Three I decide to use four pictures of the band memeber and put this in the top right hand corner, this would add contuinty through my page. Also I decide to change my signup page to a booking.html, this will let you try and book and event. By doing this I got rid of my Sign up page and Log in, as I left this was not needed.
